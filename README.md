# Accident-Data-Classification-using-Naive-Bayes
This Python project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to predict injury severity in traffic accidents based on various accident-related features. The model is trained on historical accident data to predict whether an accident results in injury or not.

This data set can be found at [accidentsFull.csv](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18577458/accidentsFull.csv)

Overall after using the model and looking at the confusion matrix we can determine that this model may not be a good fit for this dataset
